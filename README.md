# Blockchain Block Retrieval and Viewing Project

Welcome to the Blockchain Block Retrieval and Viewing project! This repository is dedicated to a web application built with React and ethers that allows you to retrieve and view the details of specific blocks on the Ethereum blockchain. The project utilizes the Alchemy provider to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Overview

This project is designed to showcase how blockchain technology can be harnessed to retrieve and display block details in a user-friendly and customizable manner. By using React and ethers, we've created a dynamic web application that allows users to explore the Ethereum blockchain's block data easily.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a responsive and interactive front-end for the application.

- **ethers**: A powerful Ethereum library that simplifies the interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. It's used to retrieve block data.

- **Alchemy**: An Ethereum infrastructure provider that enables us to access the Ethereum blockchain and retrieve data efficiently.
